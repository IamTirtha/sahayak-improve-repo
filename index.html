      <h2>1. Trust and Verification</h2>
      <p>
        SAHAYAK focuses strongly on trust and safety. Unlike many existing platforms,
        every user and worker is verified using secure authentication methods.
        This reduces fake profiles and builds confidence between households and service providers.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Clear Service Categorization</h2>
      <p>
        Services are divided into logical categories such as Household Workers
        (Cleaner, Cook, Maid) and Craftsmen (Electrician, Plumber, Carpenter).
        This structured separation helps users quickly find the service they need
        without confusion.

      <h2>3. Simplified User Journey</h2>
      <p>
        SAHAYAK is designed with simplicity in mind. The user journey from login
        to service selection involves minimal steps and clear navigation.
        This makes the platform easy to use even for non-technical users.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Balanced System for Workers and Users</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike many applications that prioritize customers only, SAHAYAK maintains
        a balanced system. Workers are treated as important stakeholders and are
        given fair opportunities to receive job requests.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Transparency in Service Flow</h2>
      <p>
        All service processes in SAHAYAK are transparent. Clear role definitions
        and structured flows reduce misunderstandings and improve reliability
        between users and service providers.

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6. User-Centric Design</h2>
      <p>
        The platform is built for users of all age groups. Simple language,
        clear layouts, and guided decision flows ensure accessibility and
        ease of use for everyone.
      </p>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7. Scalable and Future Ready</h2>
      <p>
        SAHAYAK is designed to grow. New services, regions, and languages
        can be added without changing the core system architecture.
        This ensures long-term usability and adaptability.

        social responsibility. It is not just a service booking system,
        but a reliable digital ecosystem for household service management.
